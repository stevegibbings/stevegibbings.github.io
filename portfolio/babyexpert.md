    <p>Based on the approach tested on Golf Magic, BabyExpert was fast-tracked to delivery to meet Heinz sponsorship requirements of reaching a mobile audience.</p>
    <p>I worked with a few colleagues to adapt the approach I had taken with Golf Magic. A modular Masonry style layout was used for the <a href="http://www.babyexpert.com/baby/weaning/weaningvillage/">Heinz areas of the site.</a></p>
    <p>Best visited on a real mobile device for the mobile adaptations.</p>
