    <h3>Immediate Media - UI Developer</h3>
    
    <p>02/2012 - 09/2014</p>
    
    <p>A senior member of the new digital team I worked on a number of key projects such as <a href="/portfolio/radiotimes">Radio Times</a>, <a href="/portfolio/radiotimes-offers">RT Offers</a>, <a href="/portfolio/youandyourwedding">You &amp; Your Wedding Venue Finder</a> as well as assisting in defining front-end standards and practices.</p>
    
    <p>I played a key role in Immediate's first trial of mobile optimisation using an adaptive approach due to platform limitations. This resulted in <a href="/portfolio/golfmagic">Golf Magic</a> and <a href="/portfolio/babyexpert">Baby Expert</a> from which lot a was learnt for the business.</p>
    
    <p>I introduced <a href="http://sass-lang.com/">SASS</a>, <a href="http://bem.info/method/">BEM</a> CSS structure, Javascript namespacing, linting and unit testing (<a href="http://chutzpah.codeplex.com">Chuhzpah</a> + Qunit + sinonjs + blanketjs). I played a key role in adopting responsive design and page performance optimisation.</p>
    
    <p>I am particularly proud of my work on the responsive mobile first <a href="/portfolio/youandyourwedding">Venue Finder</a> web app. I joined the small team in the prototype phase picked up Bootstrap 3 in double-quick time and brought it to launch. Post launch I led the Agile UI team encouraging continuous integration and regular refactoring as additional functionality was added.</p>

    <p>As part of adding functionality to the Venue Finder web app I forked Twitter Typeahead on

    <h3>Chameleon Net - Senior Developer</h3>

    <p>04/2006 - 04/2010</p>

    <p>As the only senior developer I was responsible for successful delivery, mentoring and keeping the development technology up to date. I introduced MVC.NET from version 1.0 and modernised the front-end with W3C Standards, jQuery (which was just out of beta) and progressive enhancement. Often required in a client-facing role I rode the line between tech and negotiation.</p>
